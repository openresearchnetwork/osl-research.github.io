### ORN Working Groups

**Introduction to ORN Working Groups**

ORN Working Groups are collaborative clusters within the Open Research Network
that focus on specific research themes or operational challenges. These groups
are composed of experts, researchers, and practitioners who come together to
drive innovations and develop solutions in their respective fields.

**Purpose and Goals**

The primary aim of ORN Working Groups is to leverage collective expertise to
advance research, share best practices, and produce actionable insights that
contribute to the broader goals of ORN. Each group operates with a clear mandate
to address particular scientific or operational objectives.

**Criteria for Formation**

- **Relevance**: The group's focus must align with ORN's strategic interests and
  the current needs of the research community.
- **Expertise**: Members should possess the necessary expertise and experience
  to contribute effectively to the group's objectives.
- **Code of Conduct**: Groups must adopt a code of conduct to ensure
  professionalism and inclusivity. We recommend the Contributor Covenant for
  groups needing guidance in formulating their own.

**Application Process**

- **Proposal Submission**: Interested individuals or teams must submit a
  detailed proposal outlining the group's intended focus, objectives, and
  expected outcomes.
- **Review**: Proposals are reviewed by ORN leadership to ensure alignment with
  organizational goals and resource availability.
- **Approval**: Upon approval, groups are officially recognized and provided
  with support and resources from ORN to commence their activities.
